## Important Info (WP3)
See Releases - "Final Release" for the work package 3 running code (attached executable folder as a zip file)
Due to integration issues, the wayside controller latest updates are in a separate branch (https://github.com/shamuraii/ECE1140/commits/mahyaw-patch-1)



### Some reflection...
This was a long and greuling semester and both individually and as a group, many difficutlies were encountered while progressing through the project. Overall, communication was very hard to maintain. Meetings were unfortunately often unable to achieve full attendance, or even be held at all. This made integration nearly impossible to achieve in the constrained time of the summer semester. A bit unfortunate, as I was really looking forward to developing a full-fledged software solution for the system at semesters end. Despite having most of the individual module's functionality implemented, enough issues remain that a full-fledged, multi-train simulation is not possible.

Maybe one day I will get bored/inspired to try finishing the system, but unlikely...
Oh well.
